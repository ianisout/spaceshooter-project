- If the enemies reach the end of the box, game over
- There's a small glitch in the system, which is not a bug but a *feature*, that is: the invading enemies move extra 4 pixels to the left every time a new enemy comes around. (Easy to be fixed - but I preferred to keep the challenge challenging ðŸ‘€)
